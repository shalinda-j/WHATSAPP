## 2024-05-19 - Use `.lean()` for read-only queries
**Learning:** In `src/server/routes/analytics.ts`, fetching documents with `find()` returns heavy Mongoose document instances. For read-only operations where we only need pure JavaScript objects, omitting `.lean()` drastically increases memory consumption and instantiation time.
**Action:** Always append `.lean()` to Mongoose `find()` queries when modifying or saving the documents is unnecessary. Additionally, combine it with `.select()` to fetch only the required fields to minimize memory footprint and network overhead.
